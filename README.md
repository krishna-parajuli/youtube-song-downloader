youtube-song-downloader
=======================
If you are having a party tomorrow, and have a list of song you would like to play, and is lazy to download each of the link, here I am, with a solution.

This is roughly made, works with ubuntu when songs are listed as list.txt in home folder. I'm too lazy to give users a chance to select file name and path, may be it will come with in next 14 days, if not you are out of luck. ;)
I know most of you are in windows, still wrapping your gift, folks.
